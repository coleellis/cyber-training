# Tree

*You should be able to code this challenge in C.*

## Overview
We are going to write a seeking algorithm that takes in the file `data.bin`, which contains a binary tree which has been serialized, reads the array using pre-order notation. The flag can be printed out by printing the value when reading each node.

## Instructions
### Reading the Array
You have been provided `data.bin` which contains the serialized array.  Each element takes the following form:

```
| Index | c | left  | right |
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
```

The parts of the array entry are:
* *Index*: The index of the current array entry.
* *c*: The value at this index, a `char`.
* *left*: The index of the left child of this node.
* *right*: The index of the right child of this node.

### Printing the Flag
The flag is generated by printing the value at each index when the tree is read using pre-order notation. Please remember that indices are meant for sorting and are not part of the value, and may not be in the correct location in the binary file.

The flag will be represented in ASCII.

## Scoring 
When preparing a writeup, you will be evaluated based on the following software engineering pillars:
* Correctness (printing the flag)
* Safe from bugs (handles bad input without crashing)
* Easy to understand (commented and inuitive program structure)
* Ready for change (modular implementation)
* Adherence to the [Google C Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
