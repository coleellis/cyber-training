# LinkedOps

*You should be able to code this challenge in C.*

## Overview
We are going to write a seeking algorithm that takes in the file `data.bin`, which contains a series of instructions that need to be performed on a Linked List. The flag can be printed out by reading the list after performing the operations.
## Instructions
### Reading the Array
You have been provided `data.bin` which contains the serialized array.  Each element contains an operational code (OP) that tells what operation to perform, which in turn has the following form:
* `0`: Add a node to the end of the list. Following this sequence is a `char` value to add.
    ```
    | OP | c |
    | 0  | 1 |
    ```
* `1`: Add a node to the front of the list. Following this sequence is a `char` value to add.
    ```
    | OP | c |
    | 0  | 1 |
    ```
* `2`: Add a node to a specific index. Following the sequence is the index to add at, and then a `char` value to add.
    ```
    | OP | index | c |
    | 0  | 1 | 2 | 3 |
    ```
* `3`: Remove a node from the end of the list.
    ```
    | OP |
    | 0  |
    ```
* `4`: Remove a node from the front of the list.
    ```
    | OP |
    | 0  |
    ```
* `5`: Remove a node from a specific index. Following the sequence is the index to remove from.
    ```
    | OP | index |
    | 0  | 1 | 2 |
    ```

### Printing the Flag
The flag is generated by performing the sequence of operations provided in the `data.bin` file and printing out the Linked List once the operations have been completed.

The flag will be represented in ASCII.  Surround the data that you get in `flag{}` braces.

## Scoring 
When preparing a writeup, you will be evaluated based on the following software engineering pillars:
* Correctness (printing the flag)
* Safe from bugs (handles bad input without crashing)
* Easy to understand (commented and inuitive program structure)
* Ready for change (modular implementation)
* Adherence to the [Google C Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
