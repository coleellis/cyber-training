# What is the Programming Section?

The programming section is a true test of your problem-solving ability using a low-level language. This section is most similar to the content covered in computer science major curriculums. **The biggest challenge is using C, a low-level language.**

* _**File Input/Output**_
* Processing C-strings
* Heap Memory Management
* Pointers

The two sections of this section are:

* _Data Serialization_ -- Reading from serialized (binary) data and processing it.
* _Programming_ -- Reading ASCII data and data processing in C.

To be comfortable with this section, you should be proficient in a low-level language (C) and a high-level language (Python).
