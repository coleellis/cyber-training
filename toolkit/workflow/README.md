# My Workflow

This section covers some of the miscellaneous tools I use to solve challenges. This includes my terminal setup, text editor, and other Linux utilities that make my life easier.

**This setup is not for everyone.** You must find the setup that works for you. This is what I use and find to be most efficient for me.

## The Stack

For the terminal, I use a themed `zsh` shell. The theme is powered by _powerlevel10k_. I often use `tmux` for splitting my terminal windows. This comes with its own drawbacks.

You can find information on installing _powerlevel10k_ [here](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k). I used the manual installation rather than a third-party like `oh-my-zsh`.

I use `Vim` as my text editor of choice. Before learning `Vim`, I used `nano` as my text editor. I work faster using `Vim`; however, there is a steep learning curve. I am confident I don't use `Vim` to its full potential, but I am comfortable with the features I use.

{% hint style="info" %}
Some people may prefer to use a program like VScode for their text editor. This is perfectly fine. I have VScode installed and use it for larger projects (like writing this guide!). However, `Vim` is a faster solution for rapid prototyping and exploit development, so I use this for challenges.
